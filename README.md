# Apricot

Apricot is my game engine I decided to make in free time out of boredom. If I succeed it should be usable for creation
of simple 2d games for game jams. Core concepts I want to follow during development:
- Engine should support extreme fast iteration speed, meaning support of .NET hot reload and general flexibility
- Support both desktop and web builds
- "Good enough" principle without too much of overengineering
- Test coverage and proper CI 

As of writing this nothing of this is supported as I am getting started, but let's see where it would take me
